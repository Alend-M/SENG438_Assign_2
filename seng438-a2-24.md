# 1 Introduction

This test plan outlines the scope, and approach  for testing the JFreeChart Jar file. It details what will be tested, the key features under evaluation,and the different types of testing that will be conducted. The following provided stategey plan utilizes the black box test development approach using equivalence class testing and boundry value testing. 


# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy
The strategy developed for creating the unit tests for class: Range and DataUtilities, was by initially analysing the javadoc provided for the JFreeChart.jar file. From this, we deduced what are the valid partitions permitted for the individual methods as well as partions explicitly stated as impermissible by the Javadoc. Once we created the breakdown of the partitions, we currate the boundry value testing and equivalence class testing following the doc inputs uitilizing black box testing techniques. 

### -- Range Class --

    1) 
        boolean intersects(double lower, double upper);
        Assume Range Class is: (1.0, 10.0)

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

In our team, we divided the work by initially each picking one method from the Range class and one method from the DataUtilities class to test. Since we needed to test 5 methods for both classes, that left 2 test files in which we completed together using pair programming by splitting into pairs. Alex and Caleb completed the reamining Range class test, and Augustin and Alend completed the final DataUtilities test case. Finally, we then all reviewed each others tests to identify issues and potential improvements in order to improve quality and coverage of tests.

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

One main difficulty that we encountered was that when testing how invalid parameters were handled, was that it would throw an IllegalArgumentException rather than an InvalidParameterException. This caused us to have to adapt our tests to catch IllegalArgumentExcpetions instead and fail the test if an exception was not thrown. 

Secondly, a minor challenge that we encountered was that when running our tests, many of them failed. At first, this made us think that our test cases may have contained errors, but in reality, the test were just failing. This mostly stemmed from our inexperience with the Eclipse IDE, so once we got use to using the IDE we better understood how the system worked.

This assignment allowed us to better understand the use cases and the details of several black-box testing techniques. Specifically, using Equivalence class testing and boundry value testing, we were able to further understand the use cases of these two techniques by applying them to real methods and a real application.

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

Agustin: The lab was very good in introducing me to JUnit, JMock and the Eclipse IDE. I really appreciated how clear and how much detail the intstructions were as it left no room for confusion. It helped me realize was areas of black-box testing I need to focus on as well as its pros and cons.

Alend: I think the lab was a good introduction into JUnit and applicaiton of mocking in software testings. I found it really helpful the detailed setup instructions for the Eclipse IDE which helped a lot for making sure I was writing valid tests with the appropriate tools. 

Alex: This lab was a very good introduction to black-box testing using JUnit, Eclipse and mocking, as well as it reinforced our understanding of the different black-box testing techniques like equivalence class testing and boundry value testing. I thought the instructions were very clear and made each step of the assignment easy to follow allowing us to better understand a common test plan approach like the one used in this lab. 

Caleb: The lab was very effective at helping us reinforce topics discussed in lecture. At this point in our program, we haven't covered mocking or the eclipse IDE, so getting some experience with both of those was great. The instructions were very straightforward in the example section of the lab, which helped guide us in learning the eclipse IDE effectively.
